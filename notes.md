# Machine Learning Notes

## Supervised Learning

* Supervised Learning: Use training data with labels.

* This Training Data trains a model.

* Training Data that has been labelled -> Train  with a classifier -> produces a model.

* Once that Model is in place you can give it an unknown input and it can make conclusions.


## Unsupervised learning

* Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.

# TensorFlow.js

* TensorFlow.js is a rewrite of Tensorflow in JavaScript.

TensorFlow.js combines:

* Core API - low level
* Layers API - higher level abstraction

# Neural Networks

 ### Simple example (2 inputs, one output):

* Each input has a feature and a weighting (constant).
* Multiply feature by weighting for each input
* Add the results.
* Pass them through an Activation Function. 
* The result is the output.
