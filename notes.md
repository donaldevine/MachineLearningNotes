# Machine Learning Notes


## Supervised Learning

* Supervised Learning: Give training data.

* Training Data trains a model.

* Get Training Data that has been labelled -> Use this data to Train  with a classifier -> produces a model. 

* Once that Model is in place you can give it an unknown input and it can make conclusions.

* TensorFlow.js is a rewrite of Tensorflow in JavaScript.

## Unsupervised learning

* Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.
